# typescript-serverless-boilerplate

This repository aims to provide a foundation to build upon for creating [AWS Lambda(s)](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) using [serverless](https://serverless.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting Started

It's assumed you have forked this repository and are running macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

1. Install `nvm` - [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

`brew install nvm`

2. Install the lts version of Node.js (the `.nvmrc` is currently 10.15.3)

`nvm install --lts`

3. Within the repository directory, install the dependencies

`npm install`

You're now up and running. To verify, start by running the tests.

`npm test`

You should see output similar to below:

```
PASS  test/functions/initial_test.ts
  Initial handler
    âœ“ responds successfully with a JSON message (4ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.863s, estimated 2s
Ran all test suites.
```

You can also invoke the initial [AWS Lambda(s)](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

`./node_modules/.bin/serverless invoke local --function initial`

This will result in output similar to below:

```

```

All functionality provided by [the dependencies within this repository](#built-with) are available as expected.
