# typescript-serverless-boilerplate

This repository aims to provide a foundation to build upon for creating [AWS Lambda(s)](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) using [serverless](https://serverless.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It was initially generated using:

`serverless create --template aws-nodejs-typescript`

and modified to an opinionated package structure, TypeScript options, and Jest testing.

## Getting Started

It's assumed you have forked this repository and are running macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

1. Install `nvm` - [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

`brew install nvm`

2. Install the lts version of Node.js (the `.nvmrc` is currently 10.15.3)

`nvm install --lts`

2. Install `serverless` as a global npm package (It's just easier that way)

`npm install serverless -g`

3. Within the repository directory, install the dependencies

`npm install`

You're now up and running. To verify, start by running the tests.

`npm test`

You should see output similar to below:

```
PASS  test/functions/hello_test.ts
  hello
    âœ“ should return Serverless boilerplate message (4ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.652s, estimated 2s
Ran all test suites.
```

You can also invoke the initial [AWS Lambda(s)](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

`sls invoke local -f hello`

This will result in output similar to below:

`serverless-offline` is included to improve the local development experience. Running `sls offline` will host your AWS Lambda(s) locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

All functionality provided by [the dependencies within this repository](#built-with) are available as expected.
